    <h2>JS Advanced</h2>
    <p>In the JS Advanced course you will upgrade your JavaScript knowledge by studying the more complex concepts such as IFFE, clousure, objects and classes. This course will develop your algorithmic thinking and build on your DOM tree. You will learn to manipulate the DOM tree, add and delete elements of it. In addition, you will learn how to test your code using Unit testing libraries. You will review the OOP part of JavaScript (inheritance, prototypes and prototypes chains). Assessment in the course is based on the submitted home and practical exam.</p>
